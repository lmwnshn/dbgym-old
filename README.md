- The original goal for Thursday is gym prototype, noop synthesizer, 799 action picker.






The question is what action space to use for the actions.. it will clearly depend on the workload so I guess 
the gym is not instantiated without one?

But actually how does this work because it seems like the gym has to be registered at init?
